Let’s go to a journey of Secure Shell authentication! 
You have arrived at your destination and go to check-in at the hotel front desk. 
The staff asked you for a government-issued ID to check your reservation and verify your identity. 
The staff checked the booking system and gave you a room key for your stay. 
With this room key, you got access to most of this hotel. 
Of course, you cannot let you get into the staff room and other people’s room. 
Still, you can use the pool with your room key and go to the gym with your room key. 
With the room key, the hotel can verify your identity without your ID. 
It will be dangerous if somebody can generate the master-key based on the room key so that they can get access to everyone’s room. It is unlikely that happened to it will need a long time to break the key.
When you check out, you need to return your key to the front desk, and that is the time you lose access to all of those resources of the hotel. 
Now, this is the end of your vacation. 
It is Monday again, let’s get back to the real world.

In the real-world practice, the hotel is the Secure Shell server, shorts for SSH server and you(or anyone stays in the hotel) is the SSH client. 
The master-key that the hotel hold is the private key for this SSH server. 
Your room key is the public key that all people stay in the hotel can have. 
The public key generated from the server private key, and you granted access to those files. 
Just like you can use your room in the hotel but you don’t have access to other people’s places. 
For every file you edited, the server knows, but other people don’t. 
The server with the private key can understand all clients who hold the public key. 
However, public key holders cannot understand each other. 
It is challenging to produce that private key using the public key. 
So this is why this method of encryption remains secure. 
Unlike you checked out from the hotel, after you log out, as long as the server does not ban you, you will still have access to it in the future!

Now you have a general idea about the SSH, but what is SSH, you may wonder what exactly is Secure Shell authentication. 
Here are details about the Secure Shell authentication or shorts for SSH authentication. 
SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows the user to connect to a secure network. 
By using the private key and public key to verify the identity, the clients can communicate with the SSH server inside the protected tunnel. 
Unlike some ways of encryption, if someone has the encrypted message and the public key, this person still not able to decrypt the message. 
With the method of key authentication, connections via SSH make the process more private and secure. 
OpenSSH is an open-source project with a large community of contributions. 
OpenSSH is one of the most popular implementations of SSH protocol. 
Now inside in most Linux, Unix, Mac OS, and Windows. With this powerful tool, we can connect to secure networks and access files remotely and safely. 
All of those technical terms can explain using examples. 
Next time you forget about SSH authentication, think about the hotel so you can remember. 
Also, don’t forget your key, that is your pass to the secure highway.
